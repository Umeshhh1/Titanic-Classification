# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project based on the famous Titanic dataset. The objective is to build a model that can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, sex, class, fare, and more.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Files:**
  - `train.csv`: Training data with labels (Survived or Not)
  - `test.csv`: Test data without labels
  - `gender_submission.csv`: Sample submission file

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To predict survival (`0 = No`, `1 = Yes`) of passengers using features such as:

- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of Parents/Children aboard)
- Fare
